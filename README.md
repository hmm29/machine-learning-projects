# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects focusing on data preprocessing and visualization techniques.

## Project Structure

- `preprocessing.ipynb`: Contains data preprocessing techniques including:
  - Data loading and exploration
  - Min-Max scaling with sklearn
  - Standardization (0 mean, 1 standard deviation)
  
- `plots.ipynb`: Contains data visualization techniques including:
  - Basic data shape and statistics
  - Skewness analysis
  - Histograms for feature distributions

- `feature_selection.ipynb`: Contains feature extraction techniques including:
  - Univariate Feature Selection
  - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Dataset

The project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which includes several health metrics and a binary classification for diabetes. The dataset has the following features:

- 'preg': Number of pregnancies
- 'plas': Plasma glucose concentration
- 'pres': Blood pressure
- 'skin': Skin thickness
- 'test': Insulin level
- 'mass': BMI
- 'pedi': Diabetes pedigree function
- 'age': Age
- 'class': Binary outcome (diabetes or not)
